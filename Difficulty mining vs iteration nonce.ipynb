    "## Difficulty mining vs iterations (bitcoin)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we  focused on the link and behavior  between iteration needed to find a nonce and the difficulty miningin  the mining process, one of the most crucial step of the PoW consensus, used in many permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin.\n",
    "If we decrease the difficulty, the set of possible solutions increases. So  a natural question arise:  how does this impact the brute force of searching for the nonce.  To answer this question, a first step that we explore in this direction is an experimental study to see if there are correlations between the number of search iterations involved in the  energy consumption and the difficulty  mining. For that, we  first recall the technical background  of the  difficulty mining in the Bitcoin, which depends on two value, the target and the difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $sha256$ be the hash function  that generates a  256-bit (32-byte) number in an almost unique way, and $MRK(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)$ the Merkle tree of the transactions. To generate a block in Bitcoin, miners work independently  on solving the following problem \\cite{b7}:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\begin{cases} \n",
    "\\hbox{Find a nonce (32-bit number) such that:} \\\\ \\\\\n",
    "sha256(Bh || MRK(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)||Nonce) \\leq T,\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\label{ineq}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $Bh$ is the hash of the last generated block and $T$ is a fixed target  which represents 256-bit number. This inequality fixes an interval of admitted solutions in the following sense:  each miner performs a brute force search of nonce which, when concatenated with $Bh$ and $MRK(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)$ forms a character string $S$, such that $sha256(S) \\leq T.$ \n",
    "Miners rely on the hashcash  \\cite{b9} algorithm to find the nonce, where a starting nonce is tested in \\eqref{ineq}  and then incremented after each test until the inequality is satisfied.  If all the miners start with the same nonce, it is considered the same  duplicated work and therefore wasted, and the first one who present  the nonce will be rewarded. To avoid this situation, in bitcoin the nonce is composed of two values: a randomized nonce different from one miner to another seen as a starting point to launch the hashcash and the nonce that will be incremented each time the inequality \\eqref{ineq} test fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  larger  the target is,  the easier the PoW problem will be, since the solutions set will be large, and this is where the notion of difficulty mining  takes place. It measures  how hard it is to find the nonce, in other words how hard it is to mine a block. It has the following expression: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "D= \\frac{Target1}{T },\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Target1$ is the maximum target used in the beginning of the bitcoin associated with the lowest difficulty (difficulty 1)  and $T$ (current target) is the number of solutions for which  $sha256$  are less or equal\n",
    " $T$, as the difficulty increases, the set of possible solutions becomes smaller, which makes mining difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, we propose that this difficulty is adjusted according to the number of agreement notifications that the miner receives. The question now is how to adjust this difficulty so that the block mining  is easy for a group of miners and difficult for other group of miners.  For this purpose, we consider  an experimental study in the following section  to explore  the impact of the variation of the difficulty of the mining on the number of increments performed to find a good candidate for the inequality.\n",
    "%For example, if a miner receives 4 notifications which represent the number of miners who agree with him, the number of possible solutions for him increases by 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, if the difficulty increases, the space of candidates that solve \\eqref{ineq}  decreases, and since the hash function returns a number between $0$ and $2^{256}$, we expect that the total number of iterations (less or equal $2^{32}$) to find the nonce increases. In this context, we are interested in the behavior of this growth of total iterations needed to test inequality \\eqref{ineq}. The  experimental study will give us a first overview  of this behavior, to understand how to vary the difficulty for different groups of miners and therefore  impact the mining process to decrease the number of iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the following parameters involved in the mining process in simplified setting :\n",
    "*  Number of all possible nonce is $2^{32}$,\n",
    "*  Target =$2^{256-p}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly for the chosen difficulty the larger $p$ is, the more the number of hash that satisfies \\eqref{ineq} decreases. We test PoW by initializing the nonce by 3 values $Nonce\\in \\{0,10000, 250000 \\}$  and incremented by one unit each time inequality \\eqref{ineq} is tested. For  fixed difficulty (fixed $p$),  in each iteration, where nonce is incremented,  we test $$sha256(Bh || MRK(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)||Nonce) \\leq Target,$$ until it is satisfied, we then consider the total iterations performed to find the good candidate associated with the fixed difficulty.

    "### The previous figures can be  explained in intuitive way as follow:\n",
    "  *   A high difficulty means a restricted space of hash results, which increases the number of iterations to find the nonce, so we notice an increasing behavior between the difficulty and the total number of iterations. \n",
    "  *  A a non-linear behavior and phases of stagnation are observed, where even if the difficulty increases we can perform almost the same iterations to find the right candidates. There are phases where the iterations are constant. This can be explained by the randomness and unstructured nature of the hash function :  the output of hash function must be  uncorrelated from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed  by changing the difficulty  to reduce the set of possible solutions of the nonce, the PoW becomes difficult, but recall that, our goal is to minimize the total iterations by adjusting this difficulty, where each miner will have a difficulty that depends on the number of miners who have the same block as him.  A first naive idea is to reduce the difficulty,\n",
    " but according to the experimental results an interesting behaviors appear. From the previous remarks the gap between the difficulties must be big to reduce significantly the number of iterations. If the gap between difficulties is small it may not decrease the iterations,  we observe a phenomena of iteration constancy.  \n",

    "## Conclusion and futures works\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we  focused on the possibility of reducing the energy consumed during the mining process, one of the most crucial step of the PoW consensus, used in many permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin. We propose to reduce this energy by acting on the difficulty  mining  during the generation of a block, first by removing conflicting transactions before mining to prevent the attack, which is part of the conditions necessary to secure the blockchain of bitcoin. Then we focused on the adjustment of the difficulty in order to reduce total iterations performed in the mining. The experimental results lead us to the following future works:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Model the link between the difficulty and the number of iterations to formalize the observed non-linear behavior. \n",
    "*  Formalize the necessary gap between different difficulties to modify the number of iterations and reduce them.\n",
